printer-proxy for Debian
------------------------

First-time setup:
  After installation, access the web interface at https://your-server-ip/
  You will be prompted to create an admin account on first access.

Adding printers:
  Navigate to Manage Printers -> Add Printer, or use the Discover
  Printers feature to automatically find network printers.

Creating redirects:
  When a printer fails, create a redirect from the failed printer's
  IP to a working backup printer. Print clients will continue to
  send jobs to the original IP, but traffic will be forwarded.

Logs:
  Application logs: /var/log/printer-proxy/
  Nginx access logs: /var/log/nginx/printer-proxy-access.log

Configuration:
  The application stores its configuration in /var/lib/printer-proxy/
  No manual configuration file editing is required.
