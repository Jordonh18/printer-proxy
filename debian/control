Description: Web-based network printer traffic redirection tool
 Printer Proxy is a web application that redirects network print traffic
 from one printer IP address to another using NAT/iptables rules. This
 allows print clients to continue using the same IP address when a printer
 fails, while traffic is transparently forwarded to a working backup printer.
 .
 Features:
  * Web-based management interface with printer discovery
  * Automatic network configuration detection
  * Password-protected access with account lockout protection
  * Full audit logging of all configuration changes
  * Support for TCP 9100 (RAW/JetDirect) printing protocol
  * Printer health monitoring with SNMP and ICMP checks
  * Self-update capability from GitHub releases
